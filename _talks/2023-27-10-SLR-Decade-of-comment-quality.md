High-quality code comments assist developers in program comprehension and maintenance tasks but ensuring their quality is a difficult task.
Quality is a multidimensional concept, therefore it requires a multi-perspective analysis.
We analyze code comments attributes by asking  "what academic support is there to assess comment quality"? We found that there exist 21 quality attributes researchers use to assess comment quality.
