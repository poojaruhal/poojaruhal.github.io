I am an [Oberassistant](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/seal.html) (Senior Research Associate) with [Prof. Harald Gall](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/seal/people/gall.html) at [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html)  since Sep, 2024.
Prior, I was a 
[senior researcher](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/zest/people/pooja.html) with [Prof. Alberto Bacchelli](https://sback.it/) at the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html)  from Sep, 2022 to Aug 2024. 
I was an early [postdoctoral researcher](https://seg.inf.unibe.ch/team/) with [Prof. Timo Kehrer](https://seg.inf.unibe.ch/people/timo/) at the [University of Bern](https://www.unibe.ch/index_eng.html). I have received my PhD (with honors) in the [Software composition group](http://scg.unibe.ch/) at [University of Bern](https://www.unibe.ch/) under the supervision of [Prof. Oscar Nierstrasz](http://scg.unibe.ch/staff/oscar) and [Dr. Sebastiano Panichella](https://spanichella.github.io/).
I work mainly on supporting developers in coding activities in software development, maintenance, and evolution aspect.
My research area lie in the general area of Software Engineering (SE), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine learning applied to SE, Program Comprehension, Object-Oriented Programming,  Green Software Engineering, and Sustainable Software Engineering.

Prior to my PhD, I have worked in software engineering industry in different profiles. I have worked as a software engineer in testing in [Samsung](https://research.samsung.com/sri-n), as a researcher in [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/), and as a software developer in [People Interactive Ltd](https://www.linkedin.com/company/atshaadidotcom/).
I can say that I have witnessed the instances of real software engineering happening in industry from various lenses.
