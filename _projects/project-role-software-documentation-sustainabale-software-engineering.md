## ABSTRACT
The software consists of various components, e.g., input, output, or supplement components. Given the increasing demand for software and rapid development of the software industry, researchers got confronted with the energy impact of software on the environment. Thus, they started to focus on measuring the energy consumption of current software and related software engineering processes to inform developers timely. Current research work in this direction has been limited to measuring the energy footprint of software using source code run time or compile time, computation power or storage power, etc., and very rarely on the supplement information. Since code comments are not compiled, they are rarely considered into such energy measurement tools.

Software documentation is an inexplicable part of the software. It helps developers in understanding and modifying the software in the development and maintenance phases. Code comments are an important type of software documentation and developers trust code comments more than other forms of documentation. However, what is the role of software documentation, particularly code documentation in greenware software development, how to measure their energy footprint, are yet unknown. To gain insights on these unknowns, we first need to understand and decompose the role of software documentation, and then accurately measure its energy impact. Such empirical understanding can help developers and researchers build or improve documentation tools to achieve overall sustainable software.

### Research questions: 
- What do developers understand by the term “Sustainable Software documentation” and
- what steps do they take to achieve it? 
- To what extent, do current tools (measuring carbon footprints or energy consumptions) consider software documentation?

### STEPS: 
- Study the current literature in sustainable software engineering and 
- Identify how software documentation has been perceived and described in state-of-the-art. 
- Conduct a survey to answer RQ1. Survey popular tools to answer RQ2.
