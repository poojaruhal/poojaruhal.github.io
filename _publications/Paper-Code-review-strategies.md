## ABSTRACT
Despite the popularity and importance of modern
code review, the understanding of the cognitive processes that
enable reviewers to analyze code and provide meaningful feed-
back is lacking. To address this gap, we observed and interviewed
ten experienced reviewers while they performed 25 code reviews
from their review queue. Since comprehending code changes is
essential to perform code review and the primary challenge for
reviewers, we focused our analysis on this cognitive process. Using
Letovsky’s model of code comprehension, we performed a theory-
driven thematic analysis to investigate how reviewers apply code
comprehension to navigate changes and provide feedback.
Our findings confirm that code comprehension is fundamental
to code review.

We extend Letovsky’s model to propose the Code
Review Comprehension Model and demonstrate that code review,
like code comprehension, relies on opportunistic strategies. Based on our findings, we discuss
how review tools and practices can better support reviewers in
employing their strategies and in forming understanding.
