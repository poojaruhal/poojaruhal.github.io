I am currently an [Oberassistant/Senior Researcher](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/seal/people/rani.html) at [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html), working with [Prof. Harald Gall](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/seal/people/gall.html).

Starting in April 2026, I will join the University of Mannheim as Professor, where I will lead the Sustainable Software Engineering Group. My research focuses on developing sustainable software systems and equipping developers with tools and methodologies to reduce environmental impact while improving the long-term quality, maintainability, and resilience of software systems.

Previously, I worked as a
[Senior researcher](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/zest/people/pooja.html) with [Prof. Alberto Bacchelli](https://sback.it/), and as a [Postdoctoral researcher](https://seg.inf.unibe.ch/team/) with [Prof. Timo Kehrer](https://seg.inf.unibe.ch/people/timo/).
I received my PhD (with honors) from the [Software Composition Group](http://scg.unibe.ch/) at [University of Bern](https://www.unibe.ch/) under the supervision of [Prof. Oscar Nierstrasz](http://scg.unibe.ch/staff/oscar) and [Dr. Sebastiano Panichella](https://spanichella.github.io/).

I also bring substantial industry experience in software engineering, having worked as a Software Engineer in testing in [Samsung](https://research.samsung.com/sri-n), as an Automation Engineer in [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/), and as a Software Developer in [People Interactive Ltd](https://www.linkedin.com/company/atshaadidotcom/).
These experiences allow me to approach software engineering challenges from both academic and industrial perspectives.
