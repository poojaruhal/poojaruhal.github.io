I am a PhD Student in the [Software composition group](http://scg.unibe.ch/) at [University of Bern](https://www.unibe.ch/) under the supervision of [Prof. Oscar Nierstrasz](http://scg.unibe.ch/staff/oscar) and [Dr. Sebastiano Panichella](https://spanichella.github.io/).
I work on mainly supporting developers in comprehending source code via comments and their maintenance and evolution aspect.
My research area lie in the general area of Software Engineering (SE), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Program Comprehension, Object-Oriented Programming, and Machine learning applied to SE.
I have co-reviewed papers of various international conference (e.g., ICSME, SANER, SATTOSE) and journal (TOSEM).

I graduated with a Master degree (M.E.) in Software System from [Birla Institute of Technology and Science](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Pilani/), Pilani Campus (BITS Pilani) in 2017.
Prior to my masters, I have worked in industry in different profiles of software engineering. I have worked as a software tester in Samsung, as a researcher in Vmware, and as a developer in People Interactive Ltd.
I can say that I have witnessed the real software engineering happening in various industries and in various profiles.
