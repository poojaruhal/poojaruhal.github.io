I am currently a [Oberassistant/Senior Researcher](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/seal/people/rani.html) at [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html), working with [Prof. Harald Gall](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/seal/people/gall.html). 
As a researcher, my work emphasizes developing sustainable software solutions and equipping developers with tools to minimize environmental impact and enhance long-term viability of software systems. 

Previously, I worked as a 
[Senior researcher](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/zest/people/pooja.html) with [Prof. Alberto Bacchelli](https://sback.it/), and as a [Postdoctoral researcher](https://seg.inf.unibe.ch/team/) with [Prof. Timo Kehrer](https://seg.inf.unibe.ch/people/timo/).
I have received my PhD (with honors) in the [Software Composition Group](http://scg.unibe.ch/) at [University of Bern](https://www.unibe.ch/) under the supervision of [Prof. Oscar Nierstrasz](http://scg.unibe.ch/staff/oscar) and [Dr. Sebastiano Panichella](https://spanichella.github.io/).
My PhD work focused on building tools and techniques to help developers assess software documentation quality, especially code comment quality.

I also bring substantial industry experience in software engineering, having worked as a Software Engineer in testing in [Samsung](https://research.samsung.com/sri-n), as an Automation Engineer in [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/), and as a Software Developer in [People Interactive Ltd](https://www.linkedin.com/company/atshaadidotcom/).
I can say that I have witnessed the instances of real software engineering challenges from various lenses.
