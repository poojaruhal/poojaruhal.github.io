<b>[Advanced Software Engineering](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/seal/teaching/courses/ase.html)</b> <br>
<b>MSc course</b>,
<i>University of Zurich</i>,
<b> 2025</b>.<br>
This course deepens students' knowledge about advanced software engineering practices. The lectures will be complemented by a development team project, which enables active learning during the lecture and a realistic use case that serves as an example to support the preparation before and after the lecture. At the end of the course, the students will present their projects. Students will be graded in three parts: the team project, individual report, and final exam.

<b>BSc and MSc course</b>,
<i>University of Zurich</i>,
<b>2025</b>.<br>
The students will work on a specific research topic in software engineering. By the end of the course, they will be asked to present a literature review on the chosen topic in the form of a report.
Furthermore, the students will take part in a simulated peer-reviewing process for the first version of the produced reports. Finally, they will share as a presentation the results of their work and discuss them with the class.

<b>[Software Modeling analysis](https://poojaruhal.github.io/teaching/2018-autumn-teaching)</b> <br>
<b>Masters course</b>,
<i>University of Bern</i>,
<b>Autumn 2018, Autumn 2020</b>.<br>
This course provide an overview about techniques to analyze complex software systems to support developers in program comprehension and maintenance tasks.
A portion of this course makes heavy use of Smalltalk, a live programming environment that supports advanced reflection metaprogramming techniques.
