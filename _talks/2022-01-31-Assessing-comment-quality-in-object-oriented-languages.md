High-quality code comments assist developers in program comprehension and maintenance tasks but ensuring their quality is a difficult task. 
Quality is a multi-dimensional concept, therefore it requires a multi-perspective analysis.
We analyze code comments from three perspectives, (i) what academic support is there to assess comment quality, (ii) what are developer commenting practices across languages, and (iii) what are developer concerns regarding code comments.
