### ABSTRACT
Software has become an integral part of scientific research workflows, enabling complex data processing and knowledge extraction. 
As a first step, we aim to explore the guidelines and policies that help developers build sustainable software.  For example, UZH as an organization also provides certain policies related to [sustainability](https://sustainability.uzh.ch/en/policy-reporting/sustainability-policy.html)

### Problem
Whether these policies cover software aspects as well or whether the UZH research groups, e.g, physics  provide guidelines internally to build sustainable software is unknown.
 If these policies lack software aspects, we aim to explore other sustainability-specific organizations,  e.g., Green Software Foundation, to identify the software sustainability guidelines.

## Steps
- Find the software sustainability related policies of UZH.
- Identify the software development related guidelines from these policies. 
- Check various research groups at UZH to see if they have similar software sustainability related policies or guidelines to build sustainable software. 
- Analyze the policies and check with one or two research groups if they use these guidelines in practice. If there are any other guidelines that they follow for the purpose.
