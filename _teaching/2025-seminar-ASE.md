The software requires constant evolution due to changing customer needs, bugs that have to be fixed, or changes in the environment. Lehman's first law of software evolution states that a software system must be continuously adapted, or it becomes less and less useful. The constant change poses many challenges, and both researchers and practitioners have recognized the importance of studying and support software evolution and the humans involved in the process. In this seminar, we will cover some of the most relevant studies, approaches, and techniques that researchers have looked at in this context.

The students will work on a specific research topic in software engineering. By the end of the course, they will be asked to present a literature review on the chosen topic in the form of a report.
Furthermore, the students will take part in a simulated peer-reviewing process for the first version of the produced reports. Finally, they will share as a presentation the results of their work and discuss them with the class.

At the end of the course, students are able to:
At the end of this course, students should be able to: 
- find and identify relevant related work reflect on a topic and discuss it;
- critically analyze and reflect on research articles; 
- review and summarize the current state of the art of the selected topic;
- reflect on possible future directions; 
- provide constructive feedback on a research report. <br>
