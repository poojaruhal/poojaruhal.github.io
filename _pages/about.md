I am a [postdoctoral researcher](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/zest/people/pooja.html) at the [University of Zurich
](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/zest.html) (with Prof. Alberto Bacchelli) since Sep, 2022. 
Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Bern](https://seg.inf.unibe.ch/) (with Prof. Timo Kehrer). I have received my PhD (with honors) in the [Software composition group](http://scg.unibe.ch/) at [University of Bern](https://www.unibe.ch/) under the supervision of [Prof. Oscar Nierstrasz](http://scg.unibe.ch/staff/oscar) and [Dr. Sebastiano Panichella](https://spanichella.github.io/).
I work on mainly supporting developers in comprehending source code in software maintenance and evolution aspect.
My research area lie in the general area of Software Engineering (SE), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine learning applied to SE, Program Comprehension, Object-Oriented Programming,  Green Software Engineering, and Sustainable Software Engineering.

Prior to my PhD, I have worked in industry in different profiles of software engineering. I have worked as a software tester in [Samsung](https://research.samsung.com/sri-n), as a researcher in [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/), and as a developer in [People Interactive Ltd](https://www.linkedin.com/company/atshaadidotcom/).
I can say that I have witnessed the instances of real software engineering happening in industry from various lenses.
I graduated with a Master degree (M.E.) in Software System from [Birla Institute of Technology and Science](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Pilani/), Pilani Campus (BITS Pilani) in 2017.
