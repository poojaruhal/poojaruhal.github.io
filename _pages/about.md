I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Zurich Empirical Software engineering Team
](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/zest.html) (Prof. Alberto Bacchelli) since Sep, 2022. 
Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the [Software Engineering Group](https://seg.inf.unibe.ch/) (Prof. Timo Kehrer). I have received my PhD (with honors) in the [Software composition group](http://scg.unibe.ch/) at [University of Bern](https://www.unibe.ch/) under the supervision of [Prof. Oscar Nierstrasz](http://scg.unibe.ch/staff/oscar) and [Dr. Sebastiano Panichella](https://spanichella.github.io/).
I work on mainly supporting developers in comprehending source code in software maintenance and evolution aspect.
My research area lie in the general area of Software Engineering (SE), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Program Comprehension, Object-Oriented Programming, and Machine learning applied to SE.
I have co-reviewed papers of various international conference (e.g., ICSME, SANER, SATTOSE) and journal (TOSEM, IST, JSS).

Prior to my PhD, I have worked in industry in different profiles of software engineering. I have worked as a software tester in [Samsung](https://research.samsung.com/sri-n), as a researcher in [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/), and as a developer in [People Interactive Ltd](https://www.linkedin.com/company/atshaadidotcom/).
I can say that I have witnessed the real software engineering happening in various industries and in various profiles.
I graduated with a Master degree (M.E.) in Software System from [Birla Institute of Technology and Science](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Pilani/), Pilani Campus (BITS Pilani) in 2017.
