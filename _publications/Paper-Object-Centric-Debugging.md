## ABSTRACT
### Context
Debugging consists in understanding the behavior of a program to identify and correct its defects. Breakpoints are the most commonly used debugging tool and aim to facilitate the debugging process by allowing developers to interrupt a programâ€™s execution at a source code location of their choice and inspect the state of the program.
Researchers suggest that in systems developed using object-oriented programming (OOP), traditional breakpoints may be a not effective method for debugging.
