## ABSTRACT
Understanding a software system consumes a substantial portion of a developerâ€™s effort. 
To support software comprehension and evolution, reverse engineering aims at creating a high-level representation of an existing software system.
 With state- of-the-art technology, abstract models of software systems are created by reverse engineering tools and analyzed using software analysis tools.
 Despite the rich functionalities offered by analysis tools, a novice user may find them difficult to use due to an unfamiliar tool environment and query language. 
 In this paper, we propose an approach that allows the developer to formulate a query in a natural language in order to overcome these obstacles.
